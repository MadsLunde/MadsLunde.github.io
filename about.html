                        <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>

                        <h2>Why this website?</h2>
                        <p>The basic concept was inspired by the "/r/ShowerThoughts" subreddit.
                            <br>I created this webiste in hopes of learning the basics of HTML, CSS,
                             Javascript, creating an ASP.NET Core backend and SQL Database.<br>As this is my very 
                             first website, I decided to only use vanilla
                              CSS and Javascript, to fully understand the fundementals before voyaging into 
                              frameworks.<br><br>If you find any bugs, or manage to break something, please do 
                              not hesistate to contact me. You will find various ways to contact me on the 
                              "Contact"-page.<br>Any feedback will be appreciated.</p>
